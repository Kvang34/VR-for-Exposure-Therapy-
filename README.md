The aim of the study was to determine whether virtual reality (VR) would be an effective tool for exposure therapy. To answer the question, we have developed three subquestions:
1) Do virtual reality reduce anxiety?
2) Do people without acrophobia have lower anxiety level compare to people with acrophobia?
3) Do anxiety level differ between individual with and without acrophobia?


The file `Code and Data Analyses` includes the codes and analyses of the data.

The file `VR_Therapy_Dataset(1).csv` is the dataset we used to do our analyses. The dataset was taken from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9ccckm545w/1.
The data collected on a sample of 60 students. Amongst the 60 students, 29 student were identified a women and 31 were identified as male. Their age ranged from 19 to 24 year olds. The data include general information about participants, such as whether they have color blindness, acrophobia, become anxious in situation, and more. It also include the blood pressure of the participant after the intervention and response to the statements from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).
